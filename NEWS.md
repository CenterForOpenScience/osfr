# osfr 0.2.0

**NOTE:** This version of osfr is a rewrite of the original codebase. It is
effectively an entirely different package and provides no backwards
compatibility with functions in versions < 0.2.0. The last version of the
previous package can be installed with the *remotes* package:

```r
remotes::install_github("centerforopenscience/osfr@v0.1.1")
```

See <https://centerforopenscience.github.io/osfr/> for details about the new
package.
