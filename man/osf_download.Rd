\item{path}{Local path where the downloaded file will be saved. The default
is to use the remote file's name.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical, if the local path already exists should it be
replaced with the downloaded file?}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicating whether to print informative messages
about interactions with the OSF API (default \code{FALSE}).}

\description{
Files stored on OSF can be downloaded locally by providing an
\code{\link{osf_tbl_file}} that contains the OSF file of interest. If the
\code{\link{osf_tbl_file}} contains a directory, a zip file containing the
directory's contents will be downloaded.

By default files are downloaded to your current working directory with the
same filename used on OSF. The \code{path} argument can be used to specify a
different destination \emph{and}, optionally,  a different filename for the
downloaded file. Note, the directory portion of \code{path} must reference an
existing directory.

# download a single file

  osf_download(analysis_plan, path = "plan_wave1.docx")

# verify the file was downloaded locally
file.exists(analysis_plan$local_path)
