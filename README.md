## Overview

osfr provides a suite of functions for interacting with [OSF][osf] that is primarily focused on project management workflows. 

OSF (Open Science Framework, <https://osf.io>) is a free and open source project management repository designed to support researchers of all technical backgrounds. The service includes unlimited cloud storage and file version history, providing a centralized location for your research materials that can be kept private, shared with select collaborators, or made publicly available with citable DOIs.
