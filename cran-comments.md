## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- replaced github links in README.md with fully specified URLs
- updated the TITLE and DESCRIPTION to place 'osfr', 'OSF', and 'Open Science Framework' in quotes
- removed the full license from builds
- fixed invalid README URLs, which resulted from migrating to rOpenSci's docs server

## Reverse dependencies

There are no reverse dependencies.
