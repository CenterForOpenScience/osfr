## Overview

osfr provides a suite of functions for interacting with [OSF][osf] (<https://osf.io>) that are primarily focused on project management workflows.

**What is OSF?**

*OSF is a free and [open source][osf-gh] project management repository designed to support researchers across their entire project lifecycle. The service includes unlimited cloud storage and file version history, providing a centralized location for all your research materials that can be kept private, shared with select collaborators, or made publicly available with citable DOIs.*

## Installation

This package is currently under development and is apt to undergo significant changes until a stable version has been submitted to CRAN. You've been warned.

Also note this version of osfr has been temporarily renamed to *osfr2*.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aaronwolen/osfr")
```

## Usage Examples

### Accessing Open Research Materials

Many researchers use OSF to archive and share their work. If you come across a paper that cites an OSF repository, osfr can be used to explore the project and download the associated files---you only need the project's URL or GUID (global unique identifier) to get started. 

Here we'll retrieve the main project for the Cancer Reproducibility Project (<https://osf.io/e81xl/>).

```{r message=FALSE}
library(osfr2)

cr_project <- osf_retrieve_node("e81xl")
cr_project
```

This returns an `osf_tbl` object with a single row representing the retrieved project. Let's list the files that have been uploaded to this project.

```{r}
osf_ls_files(cr_project)
```

This returns another `osf_tbl` with 1 row for each of the files and directories in the project. We can examine any of these files directly on OSF with `osf_open()`, which opens the corresponding file's view in your default browser.

This project contains 2 ***components***: *Replication Studies* and *Data collection and publishing guidelines*. We can list these components with osfr using `osf_ls_nodes()`.

```{r}
osf_ls_nodes(cr_project)
```

osfr is compatible with the [pipe operator][magrittr] and [dplyr][], providing a powerful set of tools for working with `osf_tbl`s. Here, we're listing the sub-components nested within the *Replication Studies* component, filtering for [*Study 19*](https://osf.io/7zqxp/) and then listing the files uploaded to that study's component. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

cr_project %>% 
  osf_ls_nodes() %>% 
  filter(name == "Replication Studies") %>% 
  osf_ls_nodes(pattern = "Study 19") %>% 
  osf_ls_files()
```

We could continue this pattern of exploration and list the files contained within *these* projects. You can also download local copies of files using `osf_download()`.


### Managing Projects

You can use osfr to create projects, add sub-components, create directories, and upload files. See the *Getting Started* vignette to learn more about building projects with osfr, but here is a quick example in which we:

1. Create a new project called *Motor Trend Car Road Tests*
2. Create a sub-component called *Car Data*
3. Create a directory named *rawdata*
4. Upload a file (`mtcars.csv`) to the new directory
5. Open the uploaded file on OSF

```{r eval=FALSE}
# create an external data file
write.csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")

osf_create_project(title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests") %>% 
  osf_create_component("Car Data") %>%
  osf_mkdir("rawdata") %>%
  osf_upload("mtcars.csv") %>%
  osf_open()
```

## Details on `osf_tbls`

There are 3 main types of OSF entities that osfr can work with:

1. **nodes:** both [projects][help-proj] and [components][help-comp] (i.e., sub-projects) are referred to as nodes
2. **files:** this includes both files *and* folders stored on OSF
3. **users:** individuals with OSF accounts

osfr represents these entities within `osf_tbl`s---specialized tibbles that provide  useful information about the entities like their `name` and unique `id` for users, and API data in the `meta` column that's necessary for osfr's internal functions. Otherwise, they're just `data.frames` and can be manipulated using standard functions from base R or dplyr.


## Acknowledgments

OSF is developed by the [Center for Open Science][cos] in Charlottesville, VA.

The original version of osfr was developed by @chartgerink and further developed by @bgrich. The current version was developed by @aaronwolen and is *heavily* inspired by @jennybc and @lucymcgowan's excellent [googledrive][] package. Seriously, we borrowed a lot of great ideas from them. Other important resources include [http testing](https://ropensci.github.io/http-testing-book/) by Scott Chamberlain and [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. Development was also greatly facilitated by OSF's excellent [API documentation][osf-api].
