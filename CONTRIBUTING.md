# Contributing guidelines

Contributions are welcome, but please do think about the maintainer. Massive pull requests with tons of changes and bad commit documentation will be difficult to understand, so please make changes iteratively and Pull Request as you go (or PR per branch).

The contribution guidelines also adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct outlined in the repository, so please make sure that you are not including any offensive comments or names in the discussions, code, etc.

__Please double check any contribution for accidental access tokens; exposed credentials are your own responsibility when contributing! OSFR code does not need to know any of your credentials in the code if you have them stored in your ~/.osf-config file__

## R style

This repository adheres to the [R style guide as provided by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). This sometimes conflicts with [the Google R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), so please be sure to check this out if you are contributing and are used to using the Google style.
